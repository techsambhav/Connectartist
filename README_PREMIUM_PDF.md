### 2. Test PDF Generation

**Note:** The first run may take 30-60 seconds as Puppeteer downloads Chromium browser. Subsequent runs will be faster.

```cmd
node scripts\test_premium_pdf.js
```

This will generate:
- `test_organizer_premium.pdf` - Professional organizer confirmation
- `test_artist_premium.pdf` - Operational artist itinerary

**If Puppeteer hangs:** Press `Ctrl+C` and run again. First-time Chromium download can be slow.

## 🚀 How It Works

### When a Booking is Created:

```
1. User completes booking form → creates Booking record
                ↓
2. Payment captured → webhook triggers
                ↓
3. notifyService.generatePdfsAndNotify(booking)
                ↓
4. pdfGenerator.generateBookingPDF(booking, 'org')
                ↓
5. buildPremiumTemplateData(booking)
   ├─ parseBookingNotes(notes) → extract structured data
   ├─ getArtistPhoto(artistId) → fetch from Profile model
   ├─ generateQRCode(url) → create verification QR
   ├─ generateSecurityCode(id) → 6-digit hash
   └─ Format dates, prices, technical checklist
                ↓
6. Mustache.render(template, enrichedData)
                ↓
7. Puppeteer generates PDF from HTML
                ↓
8. PDFs uploaded to GCS (if enabled) or served via API
                ↓
9. Emails sent with PDF attachments
                ↓
10. WhatsApp/SMS notifications sent
```

## 🔧 Data Sources

The PDFs pull data from:

### Direct from Booking Model:
- `booking._id` → Formatted as CA-BKG-XXXX-XXXX
- `booking.artistName`, `artistEmail`, `artistPhone`
- `booking.organizerName`, `organizerEmail`, `organizerPhone`
- `booking.eventDate` → Formatted as "Friday, 25 Dec 2025"
- `booking.startTime`, `venue`, `price`, `paymentStatus`

### Parsed from Notes Field:
The `booking.notes` field contains pipe-separated data:
```
Event Type: Wedding | Audience Size: 500 | Load-in Time: 17:00 |
Soundcheck Time: 18:00 | Technical Requirements: PA System, Monitors, Lights |
Stage Size: 10m x 8m | Accommodation Provided: Yes (Taj Hotel) |
Travel Allowance: ₹5000 | Additional Notes: Bride loves Sufi music
```

This is parsed into:
- `eventType`: "Wedding"
- `audienceSize`: "500"
- `loadInTime`: "17:00"
- `soundcheckTime`: "18:00"
- `technicalRider`: ["PA System", "Monitors", "Lights"]
- `stageSize`: "10m x 8m"
- `hotelName`: "Taj Hotel" (extracted from parentheses)
- `travelAllowance`: "5000"
- `additionalNotes`: "Bride loves Sufi music"

### Generated Dynamically:
- **QR Code**: Links to `https://connectartist.com/booking/{id}`
- **Security Code**: 6-digit hash of booking ID (e.g., "F1FE68")
- **Artist Photo**: Fetched from Profile model via `booking.artistId`
- **Initials**: Fallback when no photo (first letter of name)
- **Formatted Currency**: ₹75,000 with comma separators
- **Payment Status Badge**: Green "Confirmed" or Yellow "Pending"

## 🎯 Customization

### Change Brand Colors

Edit CSS in both template files:

```css
:root {
  --brand-primary: #00b894;    /* Green */
  --brand-secondary: #5b7fff;  /* Blue */
  --accent-orange: #FF6B35;    /* Orange */
  --dark: #1a1a2e;             /* Dark backgrounds */
}
```

### Add Real Logo

Replace in template header:

```html
<!-- Current: -->
<div class="logo-box">🎤</div>

<!-- Replace with: -->
<div class="logo-box">
  <img src="https://yourcdn.com/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
</div>
```

### Change QR Code Destination

Update in `pdfGenerator.js`:

```javascript
const baseUrl = process.env.BASE_URL || 'https://yourdomain.com';
const qrCodeUrl = await generateQRCode(`${baseUrl}/verify/${booking._id}`);
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '../utils/notesParser'"

**Fix:** Verify file exists:
```cmd
dir utils\notesParser.js
```

If missing, check `PDF_TEMPLATES_SUMMARY.md` for the complete code.

---

### Puppeteer Hangs on First Run

**Cause:** Chromium download in progress (200+ MB)

**Fix:**
1. Let it complete (5-10 minutes on slow connection)
2. Or pre-install: `npm run puppeteer:install`
3. Check progress in `node_modules\.cache\puppeteer\`

---

### QR Code Doesn't Scan

**Check:**
1. QR code size (should be 300x300px minimum)
2. Error correction level (set to 'H' for 30% damage tolerance)
3. Print quality (use 300 DPI)

---

### Artist Photo Doesn't Show

**Expected:** Should show initials in colored circle if no photo

**Verify:**
1. Profile model has `photo` field (string URL)
2. Template has fallback logic: `{{^artistPhoto}}...initials...{{/artistPhoto}}`
3. Check console for "Error fetching artist photo"

---

### Currency Shows "NaN"

**Fix:** Ensure `booking.price` is a number:
```javascript
price: parseFloat(booking.price) || 0
```

The `formatPrice()` function handles conversion automatically.
